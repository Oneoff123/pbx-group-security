Head of APPSEC

So, this is my dream candidate for Head of Application Security.

Our company is driven by the applications that it creates. The company's value and the service it offers, is only as good as the technology behind the applications that we develop.

As we move toward an AWS world, we are containerising more and more of our applications, and deploying them at faster and faster rates (daily or even hourly). But, they must still be secure because these applications and the code that run on them have full access, or very privileged access, to a lot of our assets. Such as, our customer's photos, our customer's data, and some cases employeesâ€™ personal data. It is critical that we create an environment where writing secure code is easy and insecure coding is automatically detected.

We need to nurture an environment where developers write secure code by default, not because they are focused on security, but because that is the most efficient and effective way to write and publish code. We do this by applying a mix of frameworks that are secure, by instigating technology that can understand the side effects of what we create. We nurture, by guiding developers in such a way that learning can occur, and by providing the right feedback, in the IDE or in the test environment about what they've done and, finally, by having an environment that protect the assets and the application in run time. This allows a deeper understanding of what is happening when things go wrong. Bringing in the person that will nurture this environment is our next step.

The person that we want to attract is somebody that will thrive on this challenge. Someone driven to figure out, or to implement, solutions for scaling application security. Because, the reality is that we already know a lot about: writing secure code, writing secure applications and creating environments where applications can be executed securely. There are a whole range of technologies that can facilitate this. The challenge is scalability, the question is how do we do it, in a way, that doesn't require a huge amount of security touch points, and where security doesn't become the bottom neck? If we could review all the code, and have all the time in the world to make the changes, maybe that's one model, but, secure as it may be, it wouldn't scale. Because we have hundreds of developers but we don't have dozens or hundreds of security consultants. So, the only way to scale this is by automating the knowledge and the workflows of the security professionals and their security knowledge, in a way, that developers have access to it every day.

Our candidate needs to be ready to join our world one of very fast development and deployment. We aim to push to production 5, 10, 20 times, 100 times, 1000 of times a day. This is where scalability of security becomes even more important. There is this interesting, crazy idea that as you move into this fast deployment, suddenly you can't do security or thread models. Or that you cannot do security standards, and you cannot have all these practices, that add value, not just to security. 

The problem has always been that application security does not focus on scalability. What we need is innovative solutions and 

[//]: # (applications?) 

implications. And our mandate seeks that, we are investing in and supporting such innovations, and the business wants this from us. That is our job, in group security, to be finding technical, innovative, human processes that provide the solutions to these problems. Our dev teams, the devops teams, and the techops, they are behind this; they want this. It's in our hands to make this happen and this is very exciting.

We already know what works. We are well placed to focus on enabling the company to accelerate as fast as it can, in a secure way. And by secure, I mean that the risk appetite, and the risk implications of what we are putting into production, meets the risk appetite of the business as well as the regulatory compliances that we are required to match.

These days 

[//]: # (please confirm you want capitalization) 

THE application is actually the whole thing. The challenge now for testing is that you basically need to test the whole system. You need to test out scaling, you need to test in production. You need to see from the perspective of the application itself, that everything that is required to run the app, from infrastructure to code is itself an application that also needs to be tested.

We need somebody that looks at these challenges and says: _"this is really exciting"_. Our ideal candidate will be very hands on. We are looking for somebody that can walk in the morning and offer encouragement, who is effective in spending time with the people that need it, who can assist in mapping out what is going on. Someone to help to fix issues, help write pull requests, 

[//]: # (please clarify proposes) 

proposes, be able to be that voice of experience. Our candidate must be the person who will, 

[//]: # (do you really want to bring up working through lunch?!) 

follow up over lunch, with architecture, help to design new systems, help to create security-by-design solutions. They must be ready to provide presentations to senior management about how application security fits, they will be capable of delegating to teams, and to be able to command a useful amount of mindshare from the network of security champions that we'll create. They need to be the bridge between the security team and the development team. We require very strong leadership, resilience under pressure and the capacity to delegate and communicate their ideas to much wider teams and players.
