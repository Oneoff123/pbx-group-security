Head of APPSEC

So, this is my dream candidate for Head of Application Security.

Our company is driven by the applications that it creates. The company's value and the service it offers, is only as good as the technology behind the applications that we develop.

As we move toward an AWS world, some compounds are becoming thinner. But those application must still be secure because those applications and the code that run on them have full access or very privileged access to a lot of our assets. Such as, our customer's photos, our cutomer's data, and some cases employeesâ€™ personal data. So, it's critical that we create an environment where writing secure code is easy and is almost automatic. 

We need to nurture an environment where developers can code in the most efficient and effective way, which means securely. We do this by applying a mix of frameworks that are secure by default, by instigating technology that can understand the side effects of what we create. We nurture by guiding developers in such a way that learning can occur, and by providing the right feedback, in the id or in the test environment about what they've done and finally, by having an environment that protect the assets and the application in run time, and massive <please verify> visualization and login. That allows the understanding of what is happening and when things go wrong. Bringing in the person that will nurture this environment is our next step.

The person that we want to attract is somebody that will thrive on this challenge. Someone driven to figure out, or to implement, solutions for scaling application security. Because, the reality is that we already know a lot about writing secure code and writing secure applications, and creating environments where applications can be executed securely. And there are a whole range of technologies that can facilitate this. The challenge is scalability, the question is how do we do it, in a way, that doesn't require a huge amount of security touch points, and where security doesn't become the bottom neck? If we could review all the code, and have all the time in the world to make the changes, maybe that's one model, but, secure as it may be, it wouldn't scale. Because we don't have hundreds of developers and we don't to have dozens or hundreds of security consultants. So, the only way this scale is by being able to automate the knowledge and the workflows of the security professionals and the security knowledge, in a way, that developers have access to it every day.

Our candidate needs to be ready to join our world one of very fast development and deployment. We post to production 5, 10, 20 times, 100 times, 1000 of times a day. This is where scalability of security becomes even more important. <please clarify> So, this is some interesting, crazy idea that as we move into this fast deployment, suddenly you can't do security, you know, you can't do thread models. And you cannot do security standards, and you cannot have all these practices, that actually add value, not just to security. 

The problem has always been that application security has not focused on scalability. And, for a whole bunch of historical reasons, <please clarify> which is kind of wise not being caught in the whole part of development. So, what we need is really innovative solutions and implications. Also, what we already know works really well. So, that you can really focus on enabling the company to accelerate as fast as it can, in a secure way. And by secure, I mean that the risk appetite, and the risk implications of what we are putting into production meets the risk appetite of the business and even the regulatory compliances, that we are obligated to match.

So, we need this person, somebody that looks at these challenges and says: _"this is really exciting"_. And our group allows that, we are investing in and supporting such activities, and the business wants this from us. That is our job, in group security, is to be finding technical innovative human processes; the solutions for these problems. And dev teams, and the devops teams, and techops, they are behind this; they want this. So, it's in play. It's in our hands to make this happen. And that's is what is very exciting.

These days the application is actually the whole thing <consider "is actually the system">. The challenge now for testing is that you basically need to test the whole system. You need to test out scaling, you need to test in production. You need to see from the perspective of the application itself, that everything that is required to run the app, from infrastructure to code is itself an application that also needs to be tested, which is also very exciting.

Our ideal candidate will be very hands on. We basically need somebody that can walk in the morning and encourage you, and spend time with that person, helping really to map out what is going on, help to fix issues, help write full requests, proposes, be able to be that voice of knowledge in terms of what need to be done. But, then, follow up over before lunch, with architecture, help to design new systems, help to create security-by-design solutions. They must be ready to provide presentations to senior management about how application security fits, capable of delegating to teams, and to be able to command a useful amount of mindshare from the network of security champions that we'll create, that will basically be the bridge between the security team and the actual the development, and the team. We do require very strong leadership, a very strong ability to come into pressure and to really be able to delegate and communicate the ideas to a much wider team and players.
