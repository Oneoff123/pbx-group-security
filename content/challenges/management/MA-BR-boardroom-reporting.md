Detail a boardroom reporting scenario that you have led, where the individuals in the room may have less of an understanding of the subject matter.

Board level reporting and education is an area I have worked on extensively over 20 years. The challeges are to tell the audience why this is important, what needs to be done and what they need to do to enable this. Risk and Reward need to be balanced. Typically such issues must be communicatted within a very short time frame, also ensuring technical language does not block understanding. The option to do nothing usually should alos be acknowledged and the consequences set out.

I have chosen a scenario based upon the introduction of new regulation which impactted a specialist unit hugely and hence required broader group support. The scenario was the introduction of ILAS regime in 2008 in responce to the GFC.

- What were the challenges you faced with this scenario?

Liquidity risk was poorly understood by many Boards - this misunderstanding had led to underinvestmnet in montoring and controls with relatively junior staff being unable to raise material risk issues with the Board. This contributed directly to the speed and scale of the Global Financial Crisis. As a consequence the political will to ensure suitable controls were in place was high leading to the introduction of new regulation (ILAS regime). This was lengthy and was being introduced quickly. The regulations impossed new quantitative ratios which required banks to hold specific amounts and types of assets. Boards needed to understand what this requirements was in order to be able to understand what level of business the bank could underwrite - directly impactting profitability. The challenge was to e able to calculate the ratio, conduct itterative impact analysis and communicate the key constraints ad issues to impactted user groups. Data was limited and of poor quality, no existing model was in place and the ability to raise mitigating assets was very constrained by market conditions. Impactted executives typically were keen to delegate the issues involved to a small risk group, due to the pressures on them to restore profits quickly. As such interest and engagement was very low, despite impact being high.

- how do you ensure your report is compiled with the audience's knowledge and understanding level in mind?

I met with the Group Treasurer and Group CRO to explain the issues involved. Out of this I was able to understand the Boards level of understanding, requirements and current priorities. From this a communication plan was developed covering all Board members, the key business functiosn and external stakeholders - including shareholders, rating agencies and regulators (in 22 jurisdication).

Board time was made available and a summary of the issues, impact and actions required was shared. Ongoing support for training (voluntarily taken up by more than 80% of Board members), reports and regulatry contact was all shared.

- What visualisation dashboards have you created to support the data in your report?

A process for calculating the impact on the key ratio of each trade was developed and this tool was shared across the business. The existing Board reports were enhanced with 2 new measures which could be tracked over time. In addition a regular specialists forum was establshed which developed a further suite of reports that could be shared with the regulators and auditors. 

- what is your preferred data visualisation tool/method?

Simplicity and clarity count at the Board level. Powerpoint remians the default tool as a result with the 'effort' going into development of clear diagrams.
