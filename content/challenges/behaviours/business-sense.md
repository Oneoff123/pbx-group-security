questions:
    - "BE-BS-01: Describe a situation when you altered your approach on a task due to a change in business requirements."
    
    I was an interim CRO working to resolve a series of regulatory observations. Part of the solution required evidencing training of the executive management team who were very reluctant to attend training. The other requirements was to have fully developed policies. To approve a policy the executive management team needed to read and review each Policy.
    
    I integrated training into the Policy document forcing management to pass Training in order to approve Policy.
    
    For Operational Risk and GDPR Compliance training requirements were much broader than the executive management team hence integrating Policy and Training caried little business benefit. As such I set up a new training programme which could be scaled across all parts of the business while seperateduly implementing Policy.
    
    - "BE-BS-04: What steps have you taken to become more educated and efficient in your role?"
    
    Education is an ongoing task. I use three broad areas - academic publications, industry forums and personal development. My most recent activities in each area are as follows - purchase Bessis 4th edition, attend joint regulator new bank approval forum and qualify as a running coach.
    
    - "BE-BS-06: Describe a time when you mentored staff on effective communication on complex or sensitive ideas in a way that is easily understood. How did you communicate this change to others?"
    
    My Operational Risk team were keen to implement a full RCSA model. This was in line with industry best practice and aligned with Operatuonal Risk regulatory requirements. I set them the challenge to communicate the key issues while not mentioning the regulator once. This focussed the presentation on the business reasons for undertaking the tasks, leading to beter understanding and buy in by the end audience. 

other-questions:     
    - "BE-BS-02: How would you typically assess the impact of your work from a cost-benefit or business-metric perspective?"
    - "BE-BS-03: How would you explain your organisationâ€™s business strategy to a client, candidate, partner, or vendor?"
    - "BE-BS-05: Describe how you use your knowledge of the organisation to get an idea approved."
