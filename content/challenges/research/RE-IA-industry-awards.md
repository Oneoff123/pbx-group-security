- Which industry awards have you been presented with?

IFR Award for Best Securitisation programme

 - What were you recognised for?
 
 The team developed a programme to reduce the cost of funds for Abbey National. This was done by securitising tranches of mortgages. The recognistion was given by IFR Magasne due to the sze of the programme - in excess of $1bn, largest ever acheived and the underlying professionalism of the structure and approach adopted. 
 
I was the risk reporter and liason for the Global Jumbo securitisation team acting between Abbey National and ANTS. Abbey National originated the mortgages, I ran the risk reports providing the loss data required by investors. This enables ANTS to communicate the risk profile of the pool in a global sales programme.

 - How did you achieve this?
 
 Regulators has introduced a new industry standard to communicate credit risk in a quantitative way - Basel 2. I mapped and aligned loss data and ratings between Abbey National's intenal grades and the Basel 2 standards. I was thus able to run stress tests / what if anlaysis to show how certain projections would impact the pool performance. This helped build investor confidnece in buying the securities and viewing them as a long term asset with a low risk profile.
 
- What are your aspirations for future industry recognition?

The work directly led to presentations with industry bodies - Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bnakers Association and individual investor discussions. Subsequent regulatory changes have reduced interest in securitisation. My ambition s to be able t acheiev the same level f industry recognition and expertise in a new area.

 - How do you hope to achieve this?
 
 Building in depth expertise by working in a high volume / innovative company. To use my contacts to identify issues not cnsdiered by others. To be able to present this reserach in a clear and constructive way to help non experts understand when to involve an expert to remove / reduce their problems.
